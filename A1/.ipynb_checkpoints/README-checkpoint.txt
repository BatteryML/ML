The environment used in this assignment is as follows:
Python == 3.9.12
jupyterlab == 3.4.4
pandas == 1.4.2
scipy == 1.7.3
numpy == 1.21.5
scikit-learn == 1.0.2
matplotlib == 3.5.1

How to run the script:
1. Start a jupyterlab server, after downloading and unzipping the entire folder 'A1'.
2. Data was downloaded from OpenML datasets and subsampled before analysis: https://www.openml.org/. Specifically data1 was downloaded from https://www.openml.org/search?type=data&id=1120&sort=runs&status=active and data2 was downloaded from https://www.openml.org/search?type=data&status=active&id=287
3. Both data are saved in the same directory as notebooks 
3. There are two notebooks, one for analysis with balanced class weights and the other without class weights. Both data loading and analysis are in each notebook file.
4. Once jupyter notebook is open, you should be able to run each cell directly.
